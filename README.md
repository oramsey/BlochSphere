Qubit Visualization Tool
Overview
This is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for visualizing quantum circuits using Qiskit and Tkinter. The application allows users to manipulate and visualize a single qubit quantum circuit. Users can apply various quantum gates, parameterized rotations, and visualize the resulting quantum state.

Dependencies
Qiskit: For quantum computing functionalities.
Tkinter: For GUI creation.
NumPy: For numerical operations.

Make sure to install these libraries before running the code:

pip install qiskit numpy

Features
Quantum Gates: Apply basic quantum gates (X, Y, Z) and parameterized rotation gates (Rx, Ry, Rz) to a qubit.
Parameterized Rotations: Choose rotation angles for Rx, Ry, and Rz gates from predefined options.
State Visualization: Visualize the quantum circuit using the Qiskit visualization tools.
Reset and Clear: Reset the circuit to its initial state and clear the display.
